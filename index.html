      <h2>Form</h2>
      <p>The form section of the calendar page was created by making a div
        element with an id. The div has text elemts such as headers and
         paragraphs the instruct the user on what information to input,
          and below these elements is a text input box for the name of the
           event, followed by selectors that lets the user select the day, start
            time, and duration of the event.</p>
      <p>After clicking the "submit" button for the form, a function finds the values
        selected in the text input as well as the drop down menus, creating an
        <strong> instance</strong> of an event class assigned to a property in
        an object. There were two reasons for this: being able to edit a list of
        events and - more importantly - the ability to give the property a name
        using string input (speicifically the event name given by the user) which
        can later be called using <strong>bracket notation</strong>.</p>
