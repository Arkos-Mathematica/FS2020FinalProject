        The Calendar alows for a user to create and delete adjustable events on a 24 hour, 7 day calendar. The page has a form area and calendar area, the form alowing unique events to be created or removed, and the calendar displaying these events as inputed.<br><br>
        This project uses instances stored in an object - dynamically edited using
        form input - to create an editable calendar, with options to change the
        name, time, date, and length of events.<br><br>
        Work distribution for this project was very even: Jordan did most of the HTML and CSS framework. Ari took most of the Javascript. By the end of the project, we worked on all parts without much distinction, primarily bringing in code snippets from previous projects or making slight adjustments to the CSS. The writing for this page was split evenly, with With Jordan describing most of the general functionality of the element and Ari writing about the Javascript. For the final two sections, as there was relatively little to write, we split up the work, with Ari taking one and Jordan taking the other.</p>
